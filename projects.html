          <div class="project-details">
            <p>
              Welcome to Ekans, a unique twist on the classic Snake game.
              Developed using Godot and GDScript, Ekans reverses the traditional
              mechanics of Snake by starting the player with a fully grown snake
              that shrinks as it eats food. As the snake shrinks, it drops
              obstacles that clutter the map, creating deadly traps that
              increase the difficulty.
            </p>
            <p>Features of Ekans:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>

              <li>
                Dynamic Hazard Generation - Shrinking snake leaves behind
