        <h2>Kickstarter: Introduction to Python & Apps</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of 2023, I completed the
          <strong>Introduction to Python & Apps</strong> Kickstarter course
          offered by Code First Girls. This 8-week course was an incredible
          experience where I learned the fundamentals of programming through
          hands-on problem-solving in Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          The course covered a wide range of topics, from object-oriented
          programming and logic to collaboratively building a web application.
          Here are some of the key modules:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Module 1: Python Basics: Data Types and Variables</li>
          <li>
            Module 2: Problem Solving: Input, Loops, and Functions with Turtle
          </li>
          <li>Module 3: Decision Making: Logic and If Statements</li>
          <li>Module 4: Lists and Dictionaries</li>
          <li>Module 5: Files, Pip, and APIs</li>
          <li>Module 6: Building Your App: Project Planning and Projects</li>
          <li>Module 7: Building Your App: Project Work Time</li>
          <li>Module 8: Project Presentations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The course concluded with an exciting group project where we built and
          presented our own web applications. Working in a team to develop a
          project from start to finish was an amazing learning experience. I had
          so much fun, and it was a brilliant way to apply everything we had
          learned throughout the course!
